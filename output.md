The UrbanPro Tutor Partner Program is an initiative designed to connect tutors with 
serious students in a digital or online setup. It allows tutors to access tools and 
resources that help them teach online more effectively and efficiently. The program aims 
to cater to the needs of both tutors and students by facilitating better connections, 
offering an improved teaching experience, and enhancing earning opportunities for 
tutors.

 Overall, the program is meant to create a mutually beneficial environment where 
tutors can increase their visibility, improve their teaching experience, and earn 
better income, while students can find quality education from trusted tutors. 
How does the Partnership Program work? 
Here’s how this program works: 
1. Contact Student(calls/messages/demos): Once you become Tutor Partner, you will 
be able to contact students via calls, messages and Demos. 
2. Student Leads (2 ways): 
    -You can contact students by logging into your accounts and contacting the incoming 
enquiries via calls or messages 
 OR 
    -You can have students book a demo session (1st online meeting) with you and get a 
chance to talk to the students before they make a decision. 
3. Conduct Demos: Once the demo has been booked, both you and the student(s)/ 
parents will attend it and you will conduct a 30/50 min class as a demonstration for 
students/parents. 
4. Regular Classes: After a successful Demo session, you talk to the student about 
regular classes/payments and schedule them as per preference.  
5. Payments: Once classes are confirmed and payments are made by the student, you 
will get payments for the classes conducted on a weekly/monthly basis. 
 
What are the communication guidelines for Tutor Partners? 
 
UrbanPro Tutor Partner is a program that has been designed to ensure that the Tutor 
and the students are provided with the best experiences possible. However, there are 
some guidelines that we request you to adhere to at all times while you are a part of the 
program.  
Guidelines are as follows: 
1. Do not share or ask for contact information: As a part of the Tutor Partner 
program, you are not allowed to share your personal contact information with the 
students. You are also not allowed to ask them for their contact information. 
Please refrain from doing so via messages, calls, demos or during classes. 
Contact information can be phone numbers, email id, external links, area 
locations or any external website details where contacts can be established 
between a Tutor and a Student. Sharing the contact details will be considered as 
a  violation and it will lead to a temporary/permanent account suspension. 
2. Do not miss demos: Once a student books a demo with you, you can reject the 
demo up to 3 hours before it starts. If you have not rejected the demo, then you 
must ensure that you attend it. Missing demos without canceling them will result 
in penalties. 
Please ensure to be present for 15 mins in the demo class even if the student has 
not joined to consider the demo session to be conducted by you. If not present, it 
will be considered as both tutor and student missed a demo session. 
3. Do not accept payments outside of UrbanPro: As a part of the Tutor Partner 
program, you are required to collect payments only through UrbanPro Secure 
Pay. Collecting payments via any means outside of UrbanPro Secure Pay will be 
considered a violation of the guidelines of the program. 
Penalties for violations: 
1st Violation: The account will be deactivated but can be self-reactivated 
immediately by the tutor simply by re-confirming their acceptance of the guidelines. 
2nd to 5th Violations: The account will be deactivated for 7 days. Accounts can be 
self-reactivated immediately by the tutor by paying a fine of 2000 coins for each 
violation. If immediate reactivation is not chosen the account will remain deactivated 
for 7 days from the date of the violation.  
6th Violation: The account will be suspended permanently. 
 
What is an UrbanPro Calendar?

How to schedule a Demo class with a student? 
 
When a student is looking for the perfect tutor, they may want to connect with you 
before making a decision. This is where the demo class becomes very helpful because 
it allows students to get a first-hand understanding of what your classes would be like. 
 
There are two ways in which students can be a part of a demo class: 
Student books a Demo: Student can book a demo with the Tutor by visiting their profile 
page. 
Tutor books a Demo: Tutor can book a demo for the student who sent in an enquiry. 
 
Steps to book a demo with a student : 
Step 1: Login to your UrbanPro account via web or app 
Step 2: Click on the student enquiry you wish to contact 
Step 3: Click on the contact button 
Step 4: Enter a message and send 
Step 5: You will now see a demo class option on the screen. Click on it 
Step 6: Click on "Book" post finalizing your preferred date/time. 
Step 7: Check Declaration and Click on "Confirm Booking" 
Step 8: Your Demo class is now scheduled for the selected date/time. 
 
Once you book a demo with a student, make sure that you attend it. Missing demos can 
affect your rankings on UrbanPro. If you can't attend the demo, reschedule it to a date 
and time that you are available at. 
 
How to reschedule a Demo class? 
 
It is essential to attend a Demo session once booked with a student. 
Missing the demo makes for a bad experience for the students and it can affect your 
rankings as well.  
You can always reschedule the demo to a time more convenient in case you are unable 
to attend. Just make sure you speak to the student before rescheduling the demo class. 
If you or the student can't find a convenient time to reschedule the demo, then you can 
reject the demo as long as it is done 3 hours before the demo starts. 
 
Here’s how to reschedule a demo: 
Step 1: Login to your UrbanPro account via web or app 
Step 2: Click on the ‘Follow Ups - Demos tab’ 
Step 3: From the scheduled tab, select the student to reschedule Demo 
Step 4: Click on "Reschedule" 
Step 5: Pick new time and date for Demo 
Step 6: Click on "Confirm Booking" to confirm that you've spoken to the student 
 
Note: If you or the student can't find any time that is convenient to reschedule the demo 
to, then you can go ahead and reject the demo as long as it is done 3 hours before the 
demo starts. 
 
How to cancel a demo class? 
 
Here’s how to cancel a demo: 
Step 1: Login to your UrbanPro account via web or app 
Step 2: Click on the ‘Follow Ups - Demos tab’ 
Step 3: From the scheduled tab, select the student to cancel Demo 
Step 4: Click on "Cancel the demo" 
 
Note: Demo can be canceled 3 hours before the demo start time. 
 
How can I group students into one demo class? 
 
We ask students a set of category-specific questions that are designed to understand 
their learning requirements. 
We can use this information to determine students who have similar interests to book a 
demo class with you at the same time. 
We allow a maximum of upto 5 students in a single Demo session. 
You can set this number while setting up your “Demo Availability”. 
This allows you to reach out to multiple students in a single session and also clarify 
doubts/questions for multiple students at the same time. 
 
What happens if Tutors or Students miss demo classes? 
 
Demos allows students and tutors to connect and helps students get firsthand 
experience of classes. This also helps the tutor to understand the student’s needs 
better. 
 
Therefore, in order to encourage all tutors to attend the demo classes (if not 
rescheduled or canceled by them), we have made certain guidelines that Tutors need to 
abide by. 
 
When students miss the demo: 
No coins will be refunded if the students miss the demo class.  
It is imperative that you follow-up with students and try to ensure they attend the demo. 
If the student is unavailable at the scheduled time, you can also reschedule the demo to 
an alternate convenient time. 
 
When Tutors miss the demo: 
If you miss demo classes, then specific penalties may apply. They are decided by the 
platform based on your attendance in the last 7 days. 
Ex: Suppose 10 students booked demos with you and you miss more than 2 demos i.e. 
20% of the demos scheduled in the last 7 days, it will count as a policy violation which 
will not only affect your ranking but also trigger a penalty as follows:  
The penalties are: 
Coins deducted: If you miss a demo class, then you will be charged additional 2X coins 
based on the number of students who attended the demo class that you missed. 
 
Suspension of account: Whenever you miss a Demo session, it will count as an 
instance of this policy’s violation. Depending on the frequency, a suspension may follow, 
as described below: 
1st instance – Suspension of account with an immediate reactivation link sent to your 
registered email ID. You can click on the link and reactivate your account. 
2nd Instance – Suspension of account for 7 days. In case, you wish to re-activate your 
account before the completion of 7 days, 2000 coins will be required. 
3rd Instance – Permanent suspension of account. 
 
How to avoid the penalty for missing Demos? 
 
Avoiding the penalties is incredibly simple. 
 
Follow the steps mentioned below: 
- Keep your Demo Availability up to date so that students don’t book demos you can’t 
attend. If unforeseen circumstances force you to miss a demo, 
- Ensure that you inform the students and reschedule OR cancel the demo. Please 
note, rescheduling/canceling a demo should be done at least 3 hours before the demo 
starts. 
 
Please understand that this policy is being put in place to ensure that we don’t end up 
offering a negative experience to students or their parents who are trusting the platform 
to deliver top quality and professional tutors. Poor experience will not only harm the 
platform but all the tutors associated with it.  
 
How to send a payment link after conducting a Demo class? 
 
Once you have conducted a successful demo class, and the student wants to study with 
you, you can send them a link to make the payment for the classes. Once sent, the 
student can open the link and use any payment method like PayTM, credit/debit cards 
or net banking to complete the process. 
 
Here’s how you can send students the payment link: 
Step 1: Login to your UrbanPro account via web or app 
Step 2: Click on the ‘Follow Ups - Demos tab’ 
Step 3: Select the student enquiry to send the payment link to 
Step 4: Click on Payment/Send payment request 
Step 5: Enter all information and send payment link 
Step 6: Your payment request will be sent with a link to complete the payment 
 
Once you have sent the payment link to the student, they can use the link sent to them 
to make the payment for the classes. 
 
How to know if a student has made a payment after the Demo Class? 
 
To view the status of the payment from your account, here are the steps to follow: 
Step 1: Login to your UrbanPro account via web/app

What is UrbanPro SecurePay escrow payment service? 
 
UrbanPro SecurePay is an escrow payment service offered to tutors and students. All 
payments made by students are deposited into the SecurePay escrow account (as per 
RBI regulations) and it will remain there until the promised number of classes are 
completed by the tutors.  
 
If you are found to be taking a direct payment from an UrbanPro sourced Student, your 
UrbanPro account will be permanently blocked. Since this is a serious issue, it breaks 
the trust forever and we will not be able to activate the account again - even if you pay 
that amount back to us. 
UrbanPro also reserves the right to showcase your profile as a blacklisted profile on its 
website, to discourage other Tutor partners from taking this route. 
 
What, Why & How of UrbanPro SecurePay? 
 
What is UrbanPro Secure Pay? 
UrbanPro Secure Pay is a way for students/parents to pay tuition fees to the tutor in a 
simple, fast and secure way. 
 
Why UrbanPro Secure Pay? 
It takes away the challenges faced by students/parents of being charged fees even 
though classes are not conducted/completed. Similarly, tutors can avoid the hassles of 
following up with students/parents for the fee after the classes are completed. 
 
How does it work? 
Once the student finalizes the tutor, he/she can select the option of UrbanPro Secure 
Pay which is displayed on the public profile page or in the message chat screen of the 
tutor. He/she can then enter the following details: 
 
How does the tutor charge? (per hour / per month / per course) 
Fees charged as per the above selection? (per hour / per month / per course) 
Number of classes 
Verify net fees (Fees charged X Number of classes) 
 
Go through Terms and Conditions and accept the same 
Click on the 'Pay Fees' link and make the payment through Credit Card, Debit Card, Net 
Banking UPI and wallets such as MobiKwik, Paytm, CCAvenue and FreeCharge. 
 
When students/parents make a payment to the tutor through UrbanPro Secure Pay the 
money is moved in an UrbanPro Secure Pay Escrow account. On receiving the 
payment confirmation from UrbanPro, the tutor can create a class schedule and start 
marking the student's attendance as and when classes are conducted. 
 
On completion of classes, UrbanPro will confirm the same with the student and release 
the money to the tutor when they request for it. Tutors will have to add the bank 
accounts details to your account for this to work. 
 
What are the deductions for the UrbanPro Partnership Program? 
 
The UrbanPro Partnership program works on a revenue-sharing model. 
Therefore, our charges are deducted from the amount the student's pay, when the 
transaction is made.  
The charges for each category may vary and may be changed from time to time. 
 
The charges applicable will be as follows: 
- The flat fee will vary from one subject to another 
- The percentage of transaction fee charged for amount exceeding the flat fee limit will 
remain between 22% to 26%  
 
UrbanPro transaction fees will be applicable based on the number of paid hours taught 
via the platform, with corresponding bonus coins provided. 
26% for 0-500 paid hours taught on UrbanPro 
24% for 500-1000 paid hours 
22% for 1000+ hours 
 
These charges apply to all payments made by a particular student (lifetime payment per 
student). This means that the flat fee is a one time deduction. 
 
Note: The fee structure is subject to change so we recommend to check the complete 
deduction details on the payment page before sharing with the student 
 
What are UrbanPro coins? 
 
- UrbanPro coins are UrbanPro currency that enables you to respond to all your student 
inquiries. 
- These coins help you to focus on enquiries you wish to respond to.  
- Tutors get these coins on upgrading to premium membership plans. 
- The number of coins differs from plan to plan. You will get more coins on purchasing 
higher premium membership plans. 
- Each category has different costs and you might be charged more coins for some 
categories than others. 
- You can respond to an enquiry by opening an enquiry alert and filling in your quote and 
message you wish to send to the student. 
- The number of coins deducted per student enquiry may vary, taking into account 
factors such as the type of classes and location. These coin deductions are determined 
through thorough market research and consideration of student behavior in different 
classes and cities. 
 
Using UrbanPro coins: 
- UrbanPro coins are deducted only when you respond to a student enquiry. Check the 
number of coins required to contact a student before responding to an enquiry. 
- The amount deducted is dependent on the category that the student is looking for 
attending classes. 
- Coins are deducted as per your usage and you can control it. 
- Also, coins are automatically deducted for all the customized responses that you have 
set to be sent automatically. 
 
 
 
How to set up customized responses to be sent on your behalf? 
 
You can just save your response with a custom quote and message on the ‘Saved 
response’ page. 
 
Now go to ‘Account - Settings - Enquiry Settings', click on 'Enquiry Preferences' and 
select the 'Auto Response' option. By doing so, you can send your customized message 
to all those customers who match your profile. Each response, of course, costs you 
UrbanPro Coins, but you will have the ‘first to respond’ advantage over other Tutors. 
 
To save your responses: 
Go to ‘Account - Settings - Saved Responses - Select a Category - Enter a message’ 
and click on Update 
 
Note: Number of coins required to respond to an enquiry and pricing of membership 
plans are subject to change without notice and without liability. We will, however, make 
reasonable efforts to inform you of the changes. 
 
Why does UrbanPro charge coins for every enquiry?  
 
Every enquiry that UrbanPro generates, we charge coins for a successful connection. 
The connection can happen over a phone call, message or via a Demo class.  
 
We charge coins to ensure that Tutor is serious and is actively engaged with the 
Platform. You earn UrbanPro Coins back when you convert an enquiry to a Student. 
Look at the coins being deducted as a lead generation fee that is refunded once you get 
a Student. 
 
However, since these are 'leads', we don't guarantee that each and every 'connected' 
enquiry will either attend a demo or make a payment. However, if you find that you are 
not able to convert even one in 20 enquiries that you get, please get in touch with our 
support team which will do its best to help you get better conversions. 
 
The number of Coins deducted for a category is determined by the average ticket size 
and the conversion rate for the given category. The plan is set up such that - if your 
conversion rate from Enquiries to Students is similar to other Tutors on the UrbanPro 
platform, you will not need to purchase Coins ever again.  
When does UrbanPro charge Coins for an enquiry? Can these Coins be 
refunded? 
Coins are charged only when you connect successfully with a student. This means that 
you connected via: 
1. A student booked a demo class with you 
2. A call got connected to the student for at least 30 seconds 
3. A message that you sent and was read by the student 
4. When an auto-response is sent to a student 
5. When an enquiry is viewed and not contacted 
Once charged, the coins cannot be refunded. 
 
What is UrbanPro coin deduction and Refund policy? 
 
In order to connect with students on UrbanPro and to interact with them, you require 
UrbanPro Coins. Coins are nothing but UrbanPro currency. Coins enable you to 
respond to a student enquiry through call, message and/or a Demo session to be 
booked with you. Tutors with UrbanPro Coins also rank above Tutors without any coins. 
 
In simple terms, look at UrbanPro Coins usage as the lead generation fee that you pay 
to UrbanPro. You earn the deducted coins back as soon as a Student pays for your 
classes. Tutors, once well established on UrbanPro, don’t need to purchase coins as 
every payment from Student keeps adding more coins into their UrbanPro account. 
 
You can purchase coins by selecting one of the coin packages available on the platform. 
Once you complete the payment, coins will be immediately credited to your UrbanPro 
account. You can then start responding to student enquiries and also start receiving 
Demo bookings. 
 
Each category has different costs and you might be charged more for some categories 
than others.  
 
Coins are charged and refunded based on the following: 
All enquiries (that you respond to or where Student contacts you) will be charged 
depending on the Initial Activity Score of the Enquiry. The activity score depends on 
how active the student is on UrbanPro for hiring a Tutor. 
 
Tutors will automatically receive certain refunds if the Final Activity Score is lower than 
the Initial Activity Score. 
 
The Activity Score goes up as a student moves further in their search on UrbanPro by  
- Posting a Phone verified enquiry 
- Connecting with Tutor on a message or a virtual call with a Tutor 
- Booking a Demo with a Tutor 
- Attending a Demo with a Tutor or receiving a payment link from the Tutor 
 
What are Enquiries? 
 
Enquiries are the requirements for tuition received by UrbanPro from various students. 
Each Enquiry shared with Tutors is: 
 
DETAILED: At least 3 different questions related to the category are answered - 
City/Pincode, Location - Online or Offline & other questions varying from category to 
category 
 
PHONE-VERIFIED: An OTP is sent to the registered phone number and the lead is 
shared only if it is OTP-verified by the student. This ensures that the phone number of 
the students is genuine. 
 
INTENT-VERIFIED: It is mandatory for each student to mention the timeline they have 
in mind to hire a Tutor. They can choose from - “Immediately”, “Within a Month” or “Just 
exploring” 
 
BUDGET-VERIFIED: For some categories, especially K-12 Tuitions, students are asked 
to specify their budget for hiring a tutor. 
 
What are Demos? 
 
Demos are Higher-Intent Enquiries since the Student has chosen to book a demo after 
posting their requirement and comparing multiple Tutor profiles or intro videos.  
Since each Demo is a Higher-Intent Enquiry, we charge additional Coins for every 
Demo booked by the Student.  
 
What are Activity Scores? 
UrbanPro will be assigning an Initial and Final Activity Score to every student enquiry. 
The Activity Scores signify the intent of the student and the level of their activity with 
Tutors on UrbanPro.  
The Initial Activity Score will decide the number of Coins charged for responding to any 
enquiry.  
The Final Activity Score at the end of the 30-day time period decides the number of 
Coins that will be automatically refunded to the Tutors. 
 
Note:  
UrbanPro will not be able to refund coins for cases where the Tutor responded to an 
enquiry but was not able to connect with the student, as long as the student connected 
with at least one tutor on UrbanPro. 
It is important for Tutors to respond to enquiries only after reviewing the details of the 
enquiry posted.  
Customer service cannot refund coins, as refunds are automatically issued based on a 
data-driven algorithm and the policy as outlined in this document 
 
Please be aware that not every enquiry you respond to, will convert. The system is 
designed in a way that if you have higher than average conversion rate and ticket size, 
you will earn enough bonus coins on student payments and in most cases will not 
require any further coins purchase.  
 
But as an initial investment to get established, you are required to purchase UrbanPro 
Coins. This ensures that only those Tutors, who are serious and who provide good 
quality classes, eventually get established as Top Tutors on UrbanPro. 
 
Note that Top Tutors are earning between Rs. 40,000 to 1,00,000 on the Platform, so 
there is clear evidence that the platform really works particularly once you get 
established as one of the Top Tutors on UrbanPro. 
 
What are virtual numbers and how to use them? 
 
Virtual numbers are intermediary numbers that you need to use when you call a 
student. 
They are not real phone numbers and are meant only for the purpose of facilitating the 
calls. 
 You must only use your registered mobile number to call a virtual number.  
Trying to call from a phone number that is not registered with UrbanPro, will ask for a 
registered number to be entered. 
They being virtual numbers, cannot be used to send messages via SMS or WhatsApp. 
You also cannot share your personal contact information on calls made using these 
numbers as that would be a violation of the Terms of Use. 
Calls made using these numbers are recorded for internal quality and audit purposes.  
Sharing personal contact information using these numbers could lead to a suspension 
of your UrbanPro account.

How are Tutors ranked in the UrbanPro Partnership program? 
 
When a student searches for a tutor on UrbanPro, they see a list of tutors that match 
their learning requirements.  
This list is presented in a specific order which is based on two main factors: 
 
Conversion rates: This is calculated based on the number of students converted vs the 
number of students contacted. The higher your conversion rate the better your chances 
of ranking higher. 
 
Average fee: The average fee per student also affects rankings. The higher your 
average fee the better your rank can be.  
 
Note : For Partnership level, Super Tutors, Top Tutors are shown before Standard 
Partner. 
 
A Tutor should have a high ranking because:  
Improved search result: Ranking higher in the search results improves your chances of 
getting demo bookings. 
Increase in earning potential: Since you will have better visibility, tendency of getting 
demo bookings is higher which leads to increased no. of regular classes with many 
more students 
Preference: Most students would like to book demos with tutors who rank first or higher 
 
Simple steps to improve your ranking: 
100% Demo Attendance: Attend all your demos since missing a demo could impact 
your conversion rates. 
 
Always use UrbanPro SecurePay: Make sure that you collect all payments via UrbanPro 
Secure Pay. This helps calculate your average fee per student. The higher this number 
the better chances you have of being ranked higher. However, make sure that you 
charge an appropriate amount in accordance with market standards. 
 
Atleast 5 student reviews: Get reviews from your students since they help other 
potential students see what others have to say about you. Reviews can exert a 
significant influence on student decisions so it's best to have as many reviews as you 
can get.    
 
How to improve your earnings from UrbanPro Partnership? 
 
Improving earnings per student is a crucial step in your success on UrbanPro. It helps 
you earn more and also improves your rankings in the UrbanPro search results. 
Improved rankings mean that you will rank higher, thereby becoming more visible to 
students. 
 
Your rank is calculated using the formula: 
Ranking factor  = (New student conversion rate) X (Lifetime earnings per student) 
 
There are two key things that you need to do to improve your earnings: 
· 1. How to improve your student conversion rate: 
- Your conversion rate is based on the number of students you contact vs the 
number of students who start classes with you.  
- A good conversion rate will not only increase the number of students you get but 
also help you rank higher. 
- Ensure that you update your profile regularly and that you mention all your 
strengths in it. 
- Ensure that you have a good intro video. 
Have a disciplined approach to contacting students. Set aside time every day to 
call/message students. 
- Make sure your demo availability is always up to date so that students can book 
demos easily with you 
- You have 50 min / 30 min to do a demo class so use them well. You can use a 
simple template for the demo class: 
   Introduce yourself  
   Ask the student their requirements 
   Explain what you offer in your classes 
   Give them a small sample class 
   Discuss the charges for the class 
If the students agree, then only send them the payment link. 
Don't miss any demos. If you miss too many demos, it could have a negative 
impact.  
Make sure to collect reviews from your students since reviews play an important 
role in new students deciding on studying or not. 
 
Let's understand this using an example: 
You have a conversion rate of  20% (4 new students from 20 contacts) and an 
average fee per student of Rs. 6,000 and another tutor has a conversion rate of 
25% (5 new students from 20 contacts) and an average fee per student of Rs. 
3,000. Now, if we consider the average earnings per student and multiply it with 
the conversion rate then you get a score of 1200 (20% x 6000 = 1200) while the 
other tutor gets a score of 750 (25% x 3000 = 750). This means that you will be 
ranked higher than the other tutor. This is why you need to ensure that you 
maintain a good conversion rate and a good average fee per student. 
 
2. How to improve lifetime earnings per student: 
Now, this is something that really depends on the student's requirements and the 
quality of your classes. However, there are things you can do to have students 
take more classes with you. They are: 
- Ensure that the quality of your classes is excellent. Good teaching will 
encourage students to come back to you 
- Offer students, extra classes, to work on any subject/chapter that they are not 
confident with 
- Build your course in steps. For example: create it in 3 tiers, Basic, Advanced 
and Expert. This allows you to engage with students at the basic level and get 
them to sign up for Advanced and Expert courses 
- Ensure that you charge competitive rates for your classes so as to make it more 
economical for students to take more classes with you 
- Follow up with students to check if they are in need of further classes

allowed to add multiple phone numbers as well.  
 
Step 6 - Address (location on the map) - We need your exact location on the

students place from your address.

a voice for your profile for whoever visits your account. Hence, it is mandatory 
that you upload a good profile picture. Tutors with credible profile pictures are 
given 1st preference by students and parents, improving your chances of getting 
shortlisted. Your photo size should be at least 100px wide and maximum up to 
10MB in size in .jpg, .png, .gif or.bmp format only. 
Ensure to upload front facing professional photograph without any sunglasses 
and eyes clearly open. 
 
Step 8- UrbanPro Verified Badge: Trust is an important factor when it comes to 
selecting a tutor. Students always look for someone whom they can rely on and 
one who can help them throughout their learning process. Earning an UrbanPro 
Badge will help you in building trust among students and increase the visibility of 
your profile. To get a urbanpro verified badge on your profile, you need to update 
your Identity document (PAN Card/ Drivers License/ Adhar Card) and certificates 
supporting your education. After our team verifies these documents a verified 
badge will be given to you. 
 
Step 9 - Qualification & Experience- Tutor qualification and experience help 
students and parents decide if the tutor will be able to meet their required learning 
needs. So, enter the details and increase your selection chances! 
 
Education- Education is one of the important reasons to get hired. Starting from 
graduate degrees, professional development courses to certifications, mention 
every educational degree that you hold or are pursuing, to prove the credibility of 
your knowledge. 
 
Languages you speak- students might prefer to learn from tutors who speak their 
language. So, mentioning the languages you speak will help in improving your 
chances of being selected by a student. For example, we hear students who say, 
“We want to learn English from a Tamil medium tutor.” 
 
Summary of experience- Many Students and parents may not have the time to go 
through your entire profile. So, a good summary will convey the right information 
that students/parents are looking for without demanding much time of theirs. 
 A description example: I am an experienced, qualified teacher and tutor with 
over 15 years of experience in teaching Maths and Chemistry, across different 
boards including CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE and State Board. Passionate about solving 
mathematical problems and chemical equations, over the years I have helped 
thousands of students overcome their fear of Maths and Chemistry. So far, I have 
worked as a Teacher with Presidency School (Bangalore), DPS (Bhagalpur) and 
Kendriya Vidyalaya (Nagpur). 
 
Step 10 - Tutoring Information- The more information you provide on your profile, 
lower are the chances of student rejecting you, when he reaches out to you. 
Students often say “I want a Tutor who teaches selective students only”. Hence 
this section allows you to tell the world whether you are a full-time or a part-time 
tutor and how many students you teach.  Don’t forget to save changes once done.  
 
Step 11 -  Gallery - Students and Parents want to know more about your teaching 
style, your class ambience, your notes etc. Your gallery section allows you to 
upload intro video/ photos/ videos/ documents to answer all such queries of your 
audience. 
 An intro video is one of the most important pieces of your profile, think of it as 
your 90 seconds sales pitch to the Student of why they should select you over 
others. Get going and upload all the material related to your classes and the 
subjects you teach on the platform and get your prospective students excited. 
(Please note any of these documents should not have your contact details, else 
our teams will have to reject it.) 
 
Step 12 - Once all the above-mentioned steps are completed, click on ‘Your 
Profile on UrbanPro’ to check how your profile looks like. 
After completing the ‘Profile Information’ section, it is also very important to 
complete your ‘Classes Conducted’ section.  
If you had created a profile earlier and were unable to enter all the details, you will 
get a notification on the top of the screen informing you that information from your 
profile is missing. 
 To check and add the information:  
1. Click on Complete Your Profile in the notification 
2. Add the information that is missing 
3. Click on Submit to save the changes 
 
This option allows you to see all the places where information needs to be added.

can remove it by clicking on the delete button on the right-hand side. 
 
How to create a great intro video? 
 
A one minute video is worth 1.8 million words. Videos tell your story, they engage 
your audience and make them feel more confident about you even before they 
interact with you.  
 
Hence we believe, a comprehensive intro video is a very essential part of your 
UrbanPro profile. Not only does it allow you to talk about yourself and your 
teaching style, but it also allows students/parents to know more about your 
teaching style. 
 
Let's look at how you can create a powerful intro video! 
 
Part 1: What information to include in the video 
The information you include in your video is crucial and ensure that you cover 
these points: 
- Your name

  How many students you’ve taught till now 
  What was the result of your students 
- If you have won any teaching related award, please mention it 
- What is the duration and schedule of your classes 
- Do you give special notes/information/tips etc? 
- A sample of you teaching a concept or a sample of your art 
- What is unique about your teaching, why should new Students join your classes 
Part 2: The setup and recording tips 
The great thing about an intro video is that you don’t need to have a big-budget 
production. It can be of simple yet good by following simple setup guidelines:  
- Use a decent camera for filming in landscape mode. You can use a mobile camera 
too. 
- Don’t have someone hold the camera. Put it on a stand or a table so there is no 
shaking. 
- Do not take vertical videos! Those are just a no-no. Take the video in landscape mode. 
- Do it in a room that has good lighting and make sure you face the light. 
- Make sure there is no source of light, a bulb, lamps or windows behind you. 
- Be well-groomed and well dressed in the video.

Retake the video until you feel confident about the video quality. 
Before you upload your video, make sure to watch it carefully once to see that 
everything is in order. 
It is also a good idea to keep the video updated with any new information about you, for 
example, you complete a certification relevant to the subjects you teach.
